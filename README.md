# Rusty GBA

A game development library focused on creating Gameboy Advance games in Rust.

Based on the awesome [gba crate](https://crates.io/crates/gba), provides a layer that take out
some parts of the hassle of `no_std` programming, **(will)** provides wrappers, macros and drivers to
ease the game development on Gameboy Advance.

An example of a project using this library, with the necessary elements to build a working
**.gba** file, and run it with debug messages in `mgba` can be found [here](https://github.com/litchipi/rusty_gbadev_test).

Work in progress, feel free to give an advice, raise an issue, bring a PR, or contribute in any other
way.
